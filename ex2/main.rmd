# Problem A: Analysis of coal-mining disasters timeseries

In this problem we will take a closer look at a famous data set of time intervals between successive coal-mining disasters
in the UK involving ten or more men killed (Jarrett, 1979). The data is for the period March 15th 1851 to
March 22nd 1962. It contains a list of floating-point numbers where the integer part specifies which year the accident occurred, and the decimal part specifies at which part of the year it occurred.

```{R rpackages,eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
# Load the coal-mining data set in the variable `coal`
# The first and last records in the variable is the
# start and end dates respectively
library(boot)

# List all other used library here in the preamble
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(invgamma)
library(ggpubr)
```


In order to get an impression of how the data we will be analyzing looks like, we start off by making a histogram with year along the $x$-axis and cumulative
number of disasters along the $y$-axis. The plot has been provided in the figure below:

```{R}
coal_by_year <- data.frame(year=as.integer(coal$date))  %>% count(year)
coal_by_year$cum_n <- cumsum(coal_by_year$n)
ggplot(data=coal_by_year, aes(x=year, y=cum_n, group=1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Cumulative number of accidents in coal-mines vs year")
``` 

Observe that between 1850 and 1890 the number of accidents per year seems to be quite constant, as the cumulative plot has a linear trend. Afterwards, we see that the trends flattens more out between 1900 and 1925. This should make sense, because advancements in the safety for the coal-miners were likely to happen at some point, which would drag this rate down. Another explanation could be a decrease in demand for coal, which would result in fewer accidents since fewer people were required to work in the coal-mines. It then increased between 1930 and 1947. This could either be because the ongoing wars required people to work under fewer safety constraints. Another reason could be that the wars increased the demand for coal, which meant that more people had to work in the mines. Both reasons would further explain why the rate fell after the wars.

We see that the dataset has several distinct periods where each period has an approximately constant rate at which the accidents occurred. Therefore it seems reasonable to assume that the coal-mining disasters
follows an inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity function $\lambda(t)$ (number of events per year), where we assume
$\lambda(t)$ to be piecewise constant with $n$ breakpoints. Let $t_0$ and $t_{n+1}$ to denote the start and end times for the
data set and let $t_k; k = 1, \dots, n$ denote the breakpoints of the intensity function. Thus,

$$
  \lambda(t) = \begin{cases}
    \lambda_{k-1} \quad &\forall \quad t \in [t_{k-1}, t_k), \quad k = 1, \dots, n \\
    \lambda_k  \quad &\forall \quad t \in [t_n, t_{n+1}].
  \end{cases}
$$

The parameters of this model is thereby $t_1, \dots, t_n$ and  $\lambda_0, \lambda_n$, where $t_0 < t_1 < \dots < t_n < t_{n+1}$. By
subdividing the observation period into short intervals, and taking the limit when the length of these intervals go to zero, one can derive the likelihood function for the observed data as

\begin{align*}
  \pi(\vect{x} |t_1, \dots, t_n, \lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_n) &= \exp\left( -\int_{t_0}^{t_{n+1}} \lambda(t) \text{d} t\right) \prod_{k=0}^n \lambda^{y_k} \\
  &= \exp\left( -\sum_{k=0}^n \lambda_k (t_{k+1} - t_k) \right) \prod_{k=0}^n \lambda^{y_k}
\end{align*}

where $x$ is the observed data and $y_k$ is the number of observed disasters in the period $t_k$ to $t_{k+1}$. Assume
$t_1, \dots, t_n$ to be apriori uniformly distributed on the allowed values, and $\lambda_0, \dots, \lambda_n$ to be apriori independent
of $t_1, \dots, t_n$ and apriori independent of each other. Apriori we assume all $\lambda_0, \dots , \lambda_n$ to be distributed from
the same gamma distribution with shape parameter $\alpha = 2$ and scale parameter $\beta$, i.e.

$$
  \pi(\lambda_i | \beta) = \frac{1}{\beta^2} \lambda_i \exp\left\{-\frac{\lambda_i}{\beta}\right\} \quad \forall \quad \lambda_i \geq 0
$$

Finally, for $\beta$ we use the improper prior

$$
  \pi(\beta) \propto \frac{\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{\beta}\right\}}{\beta} \quad \forall \quad \beta > 0
$$

Now assume $n = 1$. Then our model parameters are $\vect{\theta} = \begin{pmatrix}t_1 & \lambda_0 &\lambda_1 & \beta \end{pmatrix}^T$. The prior $\pi(\vect{\theta})$ can be found by using the fact that $t_1$, $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ are independent of each other:

\begin{align*}
  \pi(\vect{\theta}) &= \pi(t_1) \times f(\lambda_0 | \beta) \times \pi(\lambda_1 | \beta) \times \pi(\beta) \\
  &\propto \frac{1}{t_2 - t_0} \cdot \frac{1}{\beta^5} \lambda_0 \lambda_1 \exp\left\{-\frac{1 + \lambda_1 + \lambda_0}{\beta}\right\}
\end{align*}

Note that $t_0$ and $t_2$ are the start and end of the time series respectively, and so they are not parameters in our model. We are interested in finding the posterior distribution $\pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})$ up to a proportionality constant. This can be found by using Bayes law:

\begin{align*}
  \pi(\vect{\theta} | x) &\propto \pi(\vect{x} | \vect{\theta}) \pi(\vect{\theta}) \\
  &=  \frac{1}{\beta^5} \lambda_0^{y_0+1} \lambda_1^{y_1+1} \exp\left\{ -\lambda_0(t_1 - t_0) - \lambda_1(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{1 + \lambda_0 + \lambda_1}{\beta} \right\}
\end{align*}

Let $\theta^j$ denote the $j$-th element of the vector $\theta$, and let $\vect{\theta}^{-j} = \begin{pmatrix}\theta^0 & \dots & \theta^{j-1} & \theta^{j+1} & \dots & \theta^n\end{pmatrix}^T$  The full conditionals can then be written as

$$
  \pi(\theta^j | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}^{-j}) = \frac{\pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})}{\pi(\vect{\theta}^{-j} | \vect{x})} \propto  \pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})
$$

In other words, the full conditionals can be directly derived from the posterior density $\pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})$ by omitting all multiplicative factors which do not depend on $\theta^j$:

\begin{align*}
  \pi(t_1 | \vect{x}, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \beta) &\propto \lambda_0^{y_0+1} \lambda_1^{y_1+1} \exp\left\{ t_1(\lambda_1 - \lambda_0) \right\} \quad &&\forall \quad t_1 \in [t_0, t_1] \\

  \pi(\lambda_0 | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_1, \beta) &\propto \lambda_0^{y_0+1} \exp\left\{-\lambda_0(t_1 - t_0 + \beta^{-1})\right\} \quad &&\forall \quad \lambda_0 \geq 0\\

  \pi(\lambda_1 | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \beta) &\propto \lambda_1^{y_1 + 1} \exp\left\{-\lambda_1(t_2  - t_1 + \beta^{-1})\right\}, \quad &&\forall \quad \lambda_1 \geq 0 \\

  \pi(\beta | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1) &\propto \frac{1}{\beta^5} \exp\left\{ -\frac{1 + \lambda_0 + \lambda_1}{\beta} \right\} \quad &&\forall \quad \beta > 0.\\
\end{align*}

Observe that the full conditionals for $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ come from the Gamma distribution:

\begin{align*}
  [\lambda_0 | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_1, \beta] &\sim \text{Gamma}(y_0 + 2, 1/(t_1 - t_0 + \beta^{-1})) \\
  [\lambda_1 | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \beta] &\sim \text{Gamma}(y_1 + 2, 1/(t_2 - t_1 + \beta^{-1}))
\end{align*}

Furthermore, the full conditional for $\beta$ comes from the Inverse Gamma distribution:

$$
  [\beta | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1] \sim \text{InvGamma}(4, 1/(1 + \lambda_0 + \lambda_1))
$$

We want to define and implement a single site MCMC algorithm for $\pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})$. Since three of the full conditionals are standard, we will be using their distributions as proposals. This is known as Gibbs steps, and gives acceptance probabilities of 1. For the last full conditional, $[t_1 | \vect{x}, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \beta]$, we will be sampling in Metropolis-Hastings (MH) steps. It can be shown that the MH algorithm converges to the target distribution regardless of the choice of proposal distribution. 

Define $\vect{\theta}_i$ to be the realization of our parameter vector $\vect{\theta}$ at the $i$-th MCMC step. Also, let $Q(z^j | \theta^j_{i-1}, \vect{\theta}^{-j}_{i-1})$ be the proposal distribution for the parameter $\theta^j$ at the $i$-th step. Then the acceptance probability $\alpha$ for the proposal $\tilde{\theta}^j$ at the $i$-th iteration can be found to be

$$
  \alpha(\tilde{\theta}^j | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}, ) = \min\left\{ 1, \frac{\pi(\tilde{\theta}^j | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}^{-j}_{i-1})}{\pi(\theta^j_{i-1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}^{-j}_{i-1})} \times \frac{Q(\theta^j_{i-1} | \vect{x}, \tilde{\theta}^j, \vect{\theta}^{-j}_{i-1})}{Q(z^j | \vect{x},   \vect{\theta}_{i-1})} \right\}
$$

Since the full conditional for $t_1$ seems to resemble a distribution close to the exponential, it may seem tempting to use an exponential independence proposal. However, the tail of the proposal is heavily dependent on the choice of parameters, and so by choosing them wrong we might end up with a quite bad convergence rate.

A more robust proposal in this case is the random walk. Then $Q(\tilde{t_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}) = \theta^{t_1}_{i-1} + \pi(\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$ comes from a 0-centered symmetrical distribution. In our case, we have chosen a Gaussian random walk, i.e.

$$
  [\tilde{t_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}] \sim \phi(\theta^{t_1}_{i-1}, \sigma)
$$
where $\sigma$ is a tuning parameter. 

A weakness of the random walk proposal is that the Markov Chain may get stuck in a local maximum. There is no way of being certain that we are avoiding it, but by choosing $\alpha \in [0.2, 0.5]$ one at least reduces the risk for this to happens. This can be done by tuning $\sigma$. 

The proposal distribution for $t_1$ is symmetric around the current value, i.e.$Q(z^{t_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}) = Q(\theta^{t_1}_{i-1} | \vect{x}, z^{t_1}, \vect{\theta}^{-t_1}_{i-1})$. Hence,

\begin{align*}
  \alpha(\tilde{t_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}) &= \min\left\{1, \frac{\pi(\tilde{t_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}^{-t_1}_{i-1})}{\pi(\theta^{t_1}_{i-1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}^{-t_1}_{i-1})} \right\} \\
  &= \lambda_0^{\tilde{y_0} - y_0} \lambda_1^{\tilde{y_1} - y_1} \exp\left\{(\tilde{t_1} - \theta^{t_1}_{i-1}) (\lambda_1 - \lambda_0)\right\}
\end{align*}


Here, $\tilde{y_0}$ and $\tilde{y_1}$ are the values for $y_0$ and $y_1$ with the proposed value $\tilde{t_1}$ respectively.

This single site Metropolis-within-Gibbs MCMC sampler has been implemented below:

```{R}
sample_lambda0_fc = function(t0, t1, beta, y0) {
  return(rgamma(1, shape=y0+2, scale=1/(t1 - t0 + 1/beta)))
}

sample_lambda1_fc = function(t1, t2, beta, y1) {
  return(rgamma(1, shape=y1+2, scale=1/(t2 - t1 + 1/beta)))
}

sample_beta_fc = function(lambda0, lambda1) {
  return(rinvgamma(1, shape=4, scale=1/(1 + lambda0 + lambda1)))
}

sample_t1_fc = function(t1_prev, lambda0, lambda1, t0, t2, x, sigma) {
  y0_prev = sum(x <= t1_prev)
  y1_prev = sum(x > t1_prev)
  
  t1_proposal = rnorm(1, t1_prev, sigma)
  if (t1_proposal <= t0 || t1_proposal >= t2) {
    # t1 is outside range, so reject it:
    return(list(
      t1=t1_prev,
      y0=y0_prev,
      y1=y1_prev,
      accepted=F
    ))
  }
  
  y0_proposal = sum(x <= t1_proposal)
  y1_proposal = sum(x > t1_proposal)
  
  alpha = min(1, lambda0^(y0_proposal - y0_prev) * lambda1^(y1_proposal - y1_prev) * exp((t1_proposal - t1_prev)*(lambda1 - lambda0)))
  
  u = runif(1)
  accept = u < alpha

  return(list(
    t1=ifelse(accept, t1_proposal, t1_prev),
    y0=ifelse(accept, y0_proposal, y0_prev),
    y1=ifelse(accept, y1_proposal, y1_prev),
    accepted=accept
  ))
}

run_mcmc_single = function(n_iterations, x, sigma, t1_start, lambda0_start, lambda1_start, beta_start) {
  t0 = x[1]
  t2 = tail(x, n=1)
  
  result = data.frame(
    t1=c(t1_start, rep(NA, n_iterations - 1)),
    lambda0=c(lambda0_start, rep(rep(NA, n_iterations-1))),
    lambda1=c(lambda1_start, rep(rep(NA, n_iterations-1))),
    beta=c(beta_start, rep(rep(NA, n_iterations-1))),
    t1_accepted=c(T, rep(NA, n_iterations-1))
  )
  
  # Storing the current parameters in a list is practical,
  # since we can change the sampling order without having to deal
  # with indexes
  curr_params = list(
    t1=t1_start,
    lambda0=lambda0_start,
    lambda1=lambda1_start,
    beta=beta_start
  )
  
  for(i in 1:n_iterations) {
    t1_result = sample_t1_fc(curr_params$t1, curr_params$lambda0, curr_params$lambda1, t0, t2, x, sigma)
    curr_params$t1 = t1_result$t1
    
    curr_params$lambda0 = sample_lambda0_fc(t0, curr_params$t1, curr_params$beta, t1_result$y0)
    curr_params$lambda1 = sample_lambda1_fc(curr_params$t1, t2, curr_params$beta, t1_result$y1)
    curr_params$beta = sample_beta_fc(curr_params$lambda0, curr_params$lambda1)
    
    result[i,] = c(curr_params, t1_accepted=t1_result$accepted)
  }
  
  result$iter = as.numeric(row.names(result))
  return(result)
}
```

We start off with verifying that our Markov chain converges for arbitrary initial values of $t_1$. 

```{R}
n_iterations = 10000
x = coal$date

# Tuning param
sigma = 10

# Params:
lambda0_start = 80
lambda1_start = 0.5
beta_start = sample_beta_fc(lambda0_start, lambda1_start)
t1_start = 1940

# Calculate
result = run_mcmc_single(n_iterations, x, sigma, t1_start, lambda0_start, lambda1_start, beta_start)
sprintf("Acceptance rate for t_1: %f", length(result$t1_accepted[result$t1_accepted == T]) / nrow(result) )
```


```{R}
ggplot(data=result, aes(x=iter,y=t1)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Trace plot of t1 samples")

hist(result$t1)
```

We now want to implement MCMC using the following block proposals, where we will be alternating between the two proposals for each iteration:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1)$ keeping $\beta$ unchanged \\
  \item $(\beta, \lambda_0, \lambda_1)$ keeping $t_1$ unchanged
\end{itemize}
  
For the first block, we start by sampling our proposal $\tilde{t_1}$ using the Gaussian random walk as done in our single-site MCMC algorithm. Then $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ can be sampled from their joint conditional conditioned on the proposed $\tilde{t_1}$, $\pi(\lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \beta)$. Recognize that the non-normalized joint conditional can be found by omitting all multiplicative factors from $\pi(\tilde{t_1}, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \beta | \vect{x})$ that do not depend on $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$. Hence,

\begin{align*}
  \pi(\lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \beta) &\propto \lambda_0^{\tilde{y_0} + 1} \lambda_1^{\tilde{y_1} + 1} \exp\left\{-\lambda_0(t_1 - t_0) -\lambda_1(t_2 - \tilde{t_1}\right\} \\
  &\propto \pi(\lambda_0 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \lambda_1, \beta) \times \pi(\lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \lambda_0, \beta) \\
  &\Rightarrow [\lambda_0 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \lambda_1, \beta] \indep [\lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \lambda_0, \beta]
\end{align*}

We can sample the joint conditional by independently sampling $\lambda_0$ and $\lambda_1$ from their full conditionals using the proposed $\tilde{t_1}$, as they both are standard distributions. The acceptance probability is expressed as:

$$
  \alpha(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}) = \min \left( 1, \frac{\pi(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \beta)}{\pi(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \beta)} \times \frac{Q(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1}, \beta)}{Q(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1)}\right)
$$

Since $\tilde{t_1} \indep [\tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1}]$, it follows that

\begin{align*}
  Q(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1) &= Q(\tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \tilde{t_1}, \beta) \times Q(\tilde{t_1} | t_1, \beta) \\
  &= \pi(\tilde{\lambda_0} | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \beta) \times \pi(\tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \beta) \times \phi(t_1, \sigma^2)
\end{align*}
$$
  = \frac{\tilde{\lambda_0}^{\tilde{y_0} + 1}(\tilde{t_1} - t_0 + \beta^{-1})^{\tilde{y_0} + 2} e^{-\tilde{\lambda_0}(\tilde{t_1} - t_0 + \beta^{-1})}}{\Gamma(\tilde{y_0} + 2)} \times \frac{\tilde{\lambda_1}^{\tilde{y_1} + 1}(t_2 - \tilde{t_1} + \beta^{-1})^{\tilde{y_1} + 2} e^{-\tilde{\lambda_1}(t_2 - \tilde{t_1} + \beta^{-1})}}{\Gamma(\tilde{y_1} + 2)} \times \phi(t_1, \sigma^2)
$$

The posterior density $\pi(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \beta)$ up to a proportionality constant is found by marginalizing $\pi(\vect{\theta} | \vect{x})$, i.e.:

$$
  \pi(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \beta) \propto \lambda_0^{y_0 + 1} \lambda_1^{y_1 + 1} \exp\left\{-\lambda_0(t_1 - t_0) - \lambda_1(t_2 - t_1) - \frac{1 + \lambda_0 + \lambda_1}{\beta}\right\}
$$

Notice that $Q(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1}, \beta) = Q(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1)$ and $\pi(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \beta) = \pi(t_1, \lambda_0, \lambda_1 | \vect{x}, \beta)$, and so they will be on the same form as the above expressions. Inserting these into $\alpha(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1})$, we get

$$
  \alpha(\tilde{t_1}, \tilde{\lambda_0}, \tilde{\lambda_1} | \vect{x}, \vect{\theta}_{i-1}) = \min \left( 1, \frac{(t_1 - t_0 + \beta^{-1})^{y_0 + 2}(t_2 - t_1 + \beta^{-2})^{y_1 + 2}}{(\tilde{t_1} - t_0 + \beta^{-1})^{\tilde{y_1} + 2}(t_2 - \tilde{t_1} + \beta^{-1})^{\tilde{y_1} + 2}} \times \frac{\Gamma(\tilde{y_0} + 2) \Gamma(\tilde{y_1} + 2)}{\Gamma(y_0 + 2)\Gamma(y_1 + 2)} \right)
$$
